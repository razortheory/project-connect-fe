## Stack description

### Babel

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a
backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or
environments. Babel can transform syntax, polyfill features that are missing in
your target environment, do source code transformations and more. It can convert
JSX syntax, strip out type annotations. Babel is built out of plugins. Compose
your own transformation pipeline using existing plugins or write your own. Babel
tries to stay true to the ECMAScript standard, as much as reasonably possible.

### ESLint

It checks source code for stylistic as well as programmatic errors. ESLint helps
to identify some mistakes that are made during coding. It is also used for
adhering best practices and improving code quality and readability.

### Airbnb style guide

It is a set of standards that outline how code should be written and organized
and it covers nearly every aspect of JavaScript. It used as a preset for ESLint.

### Stylelint

Stylelint is a linter that helps to avoid errors and enforce conventions in
styles. It understands the latest CSS syntax, parses SCSS, extracts embedded
styles from HTML, markdown and CSS-in-JS template literals.

### Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for many filetypes.
Prettier enforces a consistent code style (i.e. code formatting) across your
entire codebase by parsing code and re-printing it with its own rules taking the
maximum line length into account.

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any
JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar
and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented,
requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

### Styled Components

Styled Components allows you to write traditional CSS to style your components
in JavaScript by utilising tagged template literals. It keeps track of which
components are rendered on a page and injects their styles fully automatically.
It generates unique class names for your styles, so you never have to worry
about duplication, overlap or misspellings. Styling is tied to a specific
component. You can style components based on their props or a global theme. It
handles vendor prefixing automatically.

### React

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's simple and declarative,
it uses just plain JavaScript to build reusable components.

### Storybook

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier
by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You
can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force
certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

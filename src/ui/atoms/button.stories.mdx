# Button

Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They
have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to
where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="primary">
    <Button>Project Connect</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
